# Workshop entity and join flow

## Intent

### Problem

Workshop codes were specified as identifying "exactly one workshop", but no Workshop
entity was ever defined — the relationship between a code, the WAIE template, and
participant workspaces was implicit. It was also unresolved what happens when a
returning user already possesses a browser workspace.

### Desired outcome

A first-class Workshop entity (title, code, status, template revision, expiry) owned
by the facilitator. Joining via `/workshop/:code` resolves the published workshop,
establishes a participant workspace explicitly associated with that workshop, and
duplicates the workshop's template revision into it.

## Scope

### In scope

- Workshop entity: id, title, code, status (DRAFT | PUBLISHED | CLOSED), template
  reference (template id + revision), optional expiry, timestamps.
- Facilitator management of workshops and their codes (create, publish, close).
- Join flow: resolve code → published workshop → participant workspace associated
  with the workshop → duplicate the workshop's template revision → open workflow.
- Distinct participant workspace per workshop join (a returning user with an existing
  browser workspace still gets a workshop-specific workspace).

### Out of scope

- Multiple concurrent templates per workshop (one template revision per workshop).
- Participant-facing workshop analytics or progress dashboards.
- Workshop scheduling or calendar integration.

## Actors

- Facilitator (admin): creates, publishes, closes workshops; owns the code.
- Participant (anonymous): joins via code, receives a workshop-associated workspace
  with a duplicated template workflow.

## User scenarios

### US-001 — Facilitator prepares a workshop

As a facilitator,
I want to create a workshop bound to a specific template revision and publish its
code,
so that participants joining the code all start from the same defined starting point.

Priority: P1

Independent value: makes the workshop reproducible and shareable without verbal setup.

### US-002 — Participant joins via code

As a participant,
I want to open the workshop link and land in my own copy of the workshop workflow,
so that I can start the exercise immediately.

Priority: P1

Independent value: one-step entry; no navigation or account needed.

### US-003 — Returning user joins a workshop

As a returning user who already has a personal browser workspace,
I want joining a workshop to give me a separate workshop workspace,
so that my existing workflows are not mixed with the workshop exercise.

Priority: P2

Independent value: prevents accidental pollution of pre-existing workflows.

## Functional requirements

### FR-001 — Workshop entity

The system SHALL support workshops consisting of: unique id, title, unique code,
status (DRAFT | PUBLISHED | CLOSED), a template reference (template id and template
revision), optional expiry timestamp, and creation/update timestamps.

### FR-002 — Code identifies one workshop

WHEN a workshop code is resolved,
the system SHALL map it to exactly one workshop.

### FR-003 — Join resolves published workshop

WHEN a participant opens the workshop deep link containing a code,
the system SHALL resolve the workshop and SHALL only proceed if its status is
PUBLISHED and it has not expired.

### FR-004 — Join establishes workshop workspace

WHEN a participant joins a workshop,
the system SHALL establish a participant workspace of type WORKSHOP explicitly
associated with that workshop, distinct from any pre-existing browser workspace.

### FR-005 — Join duplicates the workshop's template revision

WHEN a participant joins a workshop,
the system SHALL create a workflow in the participant's workshop workspace containing
a copy of the workshop's referenced template revision and SHALL open it in the editor.

### FR-006 — Workshop management restricted to facilitator

WHEN a user who is not a facilitator attempts to create, publish, or close a workshop,
THEN the system SHALL reject the action.

### FR-007 — Code validity lifecycle

WHILE a workshop is PUBLISHED and not expired,
its code SHALL be accepted for joining.

### FR-008 — Closed or expired workshop rejected

IF a workshop is CLOSED or its expiry has passed,
THEN the system SHALL reject its code on subsequent join attempts with a
"workshop unavailable" state.

### FR-009 — Re-join returns to existing work

WHEN a participant who already joined a workshop joins again from the same browser,
the system SHALL return them to their existing workshop workspace and workflow rather
than creating duplicates.

## Non-functional requirements

### NFR-001 — Join latency

Joining a workshop SHALL complete within 3 seconds under normal load (50 concurrent
participants).

Verification: load test with 50 concurrent joins; 95% complete within 3 seconds.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Facilitator publishes workshop

Traces to: FR-001, FR-006

```gherkin
Given a facilitator has created a workshop in DRAFT state bound to a template revision
When the facilitator publishes the workshop
Then the workshop's code becomes valid for joining
```

### AC-002 — Non-facilitator cannot manage workshops

Traces to: FR-006

```gherkin
Given a user who is not a facilitator
When the user attempts to create or publish a workshop
Then the action is rejected
```

### AC-003 — Join creates workshop workspace and workflow copy

Traces to: FR-003, FR-004, FR-005

```gherkin
Given a PUBLISHED workshop bound to template revision R
When a participant joins via the workshop code
Then a WORKSHOP-type workspace associated with that workshop is established
And a workflow containing a copy of revision R is created in it and opened in the editor
```

### AC-004 — Returning user gets separate workshop workspace

Traces to: FR-004, FR-009

```gherkin
Given a browser with an existing personal workspace
When the user joins a workshop
Then a distinct workshop workspace is established
And the user's pre-existing workflows are unchanged and not listed in the workshop workspace
```

### AC-005 — Re-join does not duplicate

Traces to: FR-009

```gherkin
Given a participant has already joined a workshop
When the participant joins again from the same browser
Then the same workshop workspace and workflow are returned
And no duplicate workflow is created
```

### AC-006 — Closed workshop rejected

Traces to: FR-008

```gherkin
Given a workshop that the facilitator has closed
When a participant opens the deep link containing its code
Then a "workshop unavailable" state is shown
```

### AC-007 — Draft workshop code not joinable

Traces to: FR-003, FR-007

```gherkin
Given a workshop in DRAFT state
When a participant opens the deep link containing its code
Then a "workshop unavailable" state is shown
```

## Edge cases

- Two workshops share the same template → each workshop references it independently;
  closing one does not affect the other.
- Workshop template revision is unpublished or deleted after publication → join
  reports the workshop as unavailable rather than failing silently.
- Expiry passes mid-session → already-joined participants keep working; only new
  joins are rejected.

## Business rules

- A workshop SHALL reference exactly one template revision at a time.
- A workshop code SHALL identify exactly one workshop and SHALL be shareable with
  participants (e.g. printed in the tutorial handout).
- Participant workshop workspaces SHALL be associated with exactly one workshop.

## Constraints

- Workshop management requires the facilitator role (SPEC-0013).

## Dependencies

- SPEC-0013 (facilitator authentication for workshop management).
- SPEC-0003 (templates and revisions to reference).
- SPEC-0004 (workspace model the participant workspace builds on).

## Assumptions

- A single canonical workshop (WAIE) is needed for the conference; multiple concurrent
  workshop definitions are supported by the model but not required.

## Open questions

- None currently.

## Success criteria

- A facilitator can publish a workshop bound to a template revision, and every
  participant joining the code lands in their own copy of exactly that revision in
  one step.

## Change history

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-15 | Initial specification created; introduces the previously implicit Workshop as a first-class entity |
| 2026-09-15 | Review revision: "revoke" removed as a separate concept — closing the workshop invalidates its code (FR-006/FR-008 cover all code invalidation); unpublish/deletion of a referenced template revision never breaks a published workshop per SPEC-0003/FR-017a and FR-003b |
