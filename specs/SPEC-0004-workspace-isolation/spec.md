# Workspace isolation and multi-user storage

## Intent

### Problem

Graphs are globally identified only by a unique `path`. The API returns every stored
graph, and saving upserts by that path. With 20–50 concurrent workshop participants
this causes collisions, cross-participant visibility, and impossible shared slugs (e.g.
everyone wanting `rubric-assessment`).

### Desired outcome

Every workflow belongs to exactly one workspace. Every workflow operation — load,
create, save, delete, duplicate, reset, execution — is scoped to the actor's
workspace, derived server-side from an opaque access token rather than a
caller-supplied workspace id. Anonymous users get an ephemeral workspace backed by a
high-entropy access token; LTI usage maps to its own workspace type.

## Scope

### In scope

- Workspace concept with type BROWSER | WORKSHOP | LTI.
- Opaque high-entropy workspace access token issued by the backend; the backend
  derives the allowed workspace from the token and never trusts a caller-supplied
  workspace id alone.
- Workflow entity scoped to a workspace with slug uniqueness per workspace.
- Anonymous browser workspace identity persisted in browser storage together with its
  access token.
- Full workspace-scoped CRUD: list, load/read, create, save/update, delete,
  duplicate-from-template, reset, execution.
- Migration of existing path-identified graphs into a default workspace.
- Retention based on last activity (lastActiveAt), with defined update triggers;
  BROWSER workspaces expire after 60 days of inactivity, WORKSHOP workspaces are
  retained for a bounded period after workshop close/expiry or last activity, LTI
  workspaces are permanent.
- Optimistic concurrency control for workflow saves (workflow version counter) so
  concurrent writers — e.g. two tabs in the same browser — cannot silently clobber
  each other.
- Precise LTI workspace mapping rule.

### Out of scope

- Authentication, login, and user account management (facilitator admin sessions are
  SPEC-0013).
- Real-time collaborative editing between multiple participants.
- Workspace sharing or permissions beyond "scoped to one workspace".

## Actors

- Participant (anonymous): owns one ephemeral browser workspace; when joining a
  workshop, additionally receives a workshop-associated workspace (SPEC-0014).
- Instructor (LTI context): workspace tied to the LTI launch context.
- Expert user: browser workspace (no account system exists; a personal
  account-backed workspace type is deferred until user accounts are introduced).
- Facilitator: may hold the workshop workspace containing prepared workflows.

## User scenarios

### US-001 — Participants never collide

As a participant,
I want my workflows stored in my own workspace,
so that my edits and saves cannot affect or be affected by other participants.

Priority: P1

Independent value: makes multi-user operation safe without accounts.

### US-002 — Same slug in every workspace

As a participant,
I want to name my workflow `rubric-assessment` even when others use the same name,
so that naming is natural and collisions do not block saving.

Priority: P1

Independent value: removes a class of confusing save failures.

### US-003 — Scoped workflow list

As a participant,
I want the workflow dropdown to show only my own workflows,
so that I do not see or accidentally edit other participants' work.

Priority: P1

Independent value: privacy and reduced cognitive load.

## Functional requirements

### FR-001 — Workspace scoping of all operations

WHEN any workflow operation is performed (list, load/read, create, save/update,
delete, duplicate-from-template, reset, execution),
the system SHALL scope the operation to exactly one workspace.

### FR-002 — Workflow identity

The system SHALL identify workflows by a workspace reference plus a slug, and SHALL
enforce slug uniqueness within a workspace.

### FR-003 — Anonymous workspace with access token

WHEN an anonymous user first uses NodeGrade in a browser session,
the system SHALL establish an ephemeral workspace and SHALL issue an opaque
high-entropy workspace access token, persisted in browser storage together with the
workspace reference.

### FR-004 — Server-side authorization from token

WHEN any workspace-scoped request is performed,
the system SHALL derive the allowed workspace from the presented access token and
SHALL NOT authorize a request based on a caller-supplied workspace id alone.

### FR-005 — Same slug across workspaces

WHEN two different workspaces each save a workflow with the same slug,
the system SHALL store them as distinct workflows.

### FR-006 — Save is scoped

WHEN a user saves a workflow,
the system SHALL update only the workflow matching the user's workspace and slug,
and SHALL never create or modify a workflow in another workspace.

### FR-007 — Migration of existing graphs

WHEN the system is migrated to workspace-scoped storage,
the system SHALL place all pre-existing path-identified graphs into a single default
workspace while preserving their content.

### FR-008 — LTI workspace mapping

WHEN a workflow is created via an LTI launch context,
the system SHALL associate it with a workspace of type LTI keyed by the stable
combination of the launch issuer and the launch context/resource identity, so that
the same launch context consistently maps to the same workspace.

### FR-009 — Retention based on last activity

WHEN a BROWSER-type workspace has had no activity for 60 days,
the system SHALL delete that workspace together with all workflows it contains.

### FR-009a — Workshop workspace retention

WHEN a WORKSHOP-type workspace has had no activity for 60 days AND its workshop is
CLOSED or expired,
the system SHALL delete that workspace together with all workflows it contains.

### FR-009b — LTI workspaces permanent

WHILE a workspace is of type LTI,
the system SHALL NOT auto-delete it under the retention policy.

### FR-010 — Activity tracking

WHEN a workspace is created or any authenticated workspace-scoped operation succeeds,
the system SHALL update the workspace's lastActiveAt timestamp.

### FR-011 — Retention scope

WHILE a workspace is of type LTI,
or WHILE a WORKSHOP-type workspace's workshop is neither CLOSED nor expired and the
workspace has been active within 60 days,
the system SHALL NOT auto-delete it under the retention policy.

### FR-012 — Optimistic concurrency on save

WHEN a workflow is saved,
the system SHALL carry the workflow's current version number with the save and SHALL
increment the stored version on success.

### FR-013 — Stale save conflict

IF a save arrives whose expected version does not match the stored version,
THEN the system SHALL reject the save with a conflict indication and SHALL NOT
overwrite the newer stored state.

## Non-functional requirements

### NFR-001 — Ephemeral persistence

An anonymous workspace identity SHALL survive page reloads within the same browser
profile for the duration of the workshop.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — Two participants, same slug

Traces to: FR-002, FR-005

```gherkin
Given two different anonymous workspaces
When each workspace saves a workflow with slug "rubric-assessment"
Then two distinct workflows exist, one per workspace
```

### AC-002 — Listing is scoped

Traces to: FR-001

```gherkin
Given workflows exist in workspace A and workspace B
When a user in workspace A lists workflows
Then only workspace A workflows are returned
```

### AC-003 — Anonymous identity persists across reload

Traces to: FR-003, NFR-001

```gherkin
Given an anonymous user has an established workspace
When the user reloads the page
Then the same workspace is used and their workflows are visible
```

### AC-004 — Save cannot cross workspaces

Traces to: FR-006

```gherkin
Given a workflow exists in workspace B
When a user in workspace A saves their own workflow
Then the workspace B workflow is unchanged
```

### AC-005 — Existing graphs preserved on migration

Traces to: FR-007

```gherkin
Given the system contains pre-migration graphs
When the migration to workspace storage completes
Then every pre-existing graph is accessible in the default workspace with unchanged content
```

### AC-006 — Idle workspaces expire after 60 days

Traces to: FR-009, FR-010

```gherkin
Given a BROWSER-type workspace with no activity for more than 60 days
When the retention cleanup runs
Then the workspace and all of its workflows are deleted
And a BROWSER-type workspace with activity within 60 days is not deleted
And LTI workspaces are never auto-deleted
And a WORKSHOP workspace of an active (not closed/expired) workshop is not deleted
```

### AC-006a — Workshop workspace retained after close, then expires

Traces to: FR-009a, FR-011

```gherkin
Given a WORKSHOP workspace whose workshop was closed 10 days ago and has been inactive since
When the retention cleanup runs
Then the workspace is not deleted
And when the workspace has had no activity for 60 days after the workshop closed
Then the workspace and its workflows are deleted
```

### AC-006b — Stale save rejected with conflict

Traces to: FR-012, FR-013

```gherkin
Given the same workflow open in two tabs of the same browser
When tab 1 saves version 5 and then tab 2 saves expecting version 4
Then tab 2's save is rejected with a conflict indication
And the stored workflow remains tab 1's version-5 state
```

### AC-007 — Workspace id alone does not authorize

Traces to: FR-004

```gherkin
Given a request presenting workspace B's id but workspace A's access token
When the request targets workspace B's workflows
Then the request is rejected or resolved against workspace A only
And workspace B's content is not returned
```

### AC-008 — Load and delete are scoped

Traces to: FR-001

```gherkin
Given a workflow exists in workspace B
When a user in workspace A attempts to load or delete that workflow by id
Then the operation is rejected
```

### AC-009 — LTI launch maps to stable workspace

Traces to: FR-008

```gherkin
Given an LTI launch from the same issuer and context twice
When workflows are created in both launches
Then both workflows belong to the same LTI workspace
And a launch from a different context maps to a different workspace
```

## Edge cases

- Browser storage cleared mid-workshop → a new ephemeral workspace is created;
  previous workflows are unreachable (accepted trade-off, documented).
- Two tabs in the same browser → they share the same ephemeral workspace and token.
- A participant returns after 60+ days of inactivity → their workflows are gone; this
  is the documented cost of the retention policy and may only surprise outside the
  workshop window, where no work is expected to be preserved.
- A stolen workspace id without the access token → grants nothing; all requests are
  authorized from the token.

## Business rules

- Every workflow SHALL belong to exactly one workspace at all times.
- Retention deletion SHALL apply only to BROWSER-type workspaces (60 days
  inactivity) and WORKSHOP-type workspaces (60 days inactivity after their workshop
  is CLOSED or expired); LTI workspaces are never auto-deleted.
- A workspace id SHALL NOT itself be an authorization credential; authorization SHALL
  derive from the workspace access token.

## Constraints

- Existing stored graph content format must remain readable during migration.
- The workspace access token SHALL be opaque and high-entropy; it SHALL NOT be
  derivable from the workspace id.

## Dependencies

- None (this is a prerequisite for SPEC-0002, SPEC-0003, and SPEC-0014).

## Assumptions

- No authentication is required for anonymous users; the workspace access token alone
  provides adequate isolation for the conference scenario.

## Open questions

- None currently.

## Success criteria

- 20–50 concurrent participants can each save a workflow with the same slug without
  collisions, cross-visibility, or IDOR-style access to other participants' graphs.

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-15 | Initial specification created |
| 2026-09-15 | Retention decision: anonymous workspaces auto-delete after 60 days (FR-008, AC-006); open question resolved |
| 2026-09-15 | Hardened isolation: opaque workspace access tokens as authorization (FR-003/004, AC-007), full CRUD scoping (FR-001, AC-008), retention re-anchored to lastActiveAt with defined update triggers (FR-009/010, AC-006), workspace types BROWSER|WORKSHOP|LTI|PERSONAL, precise LTI mapping rule (FR-008, AC-009), workshop workspaces exempt from retention (FR-011) |
| 2026-09-15 | Review revision 2: PERSONAL workspace type dropped (no account system exists to authenticate or recover it) — types are now BROWSER | WORKSHOP | LTI; WORKSHOP workspaces no longer live forever: retained 60 days after workshop close/expiry or last activity (FR-009a/FR-011, AC-006a); optimistic concurrency added so same-browser multi-tab saves cannot silently clobber newer state (FR-012/FR-013, AC-006b) |
