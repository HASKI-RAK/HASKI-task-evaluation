# WAIE workshop experience and preview

## Intent

### Problem

The tutorial promises participants a canonical free-text assessment workflow (WAIE)
they can adapt — changing rubrics, feedback strategies, or adding validation/review
steps. No such canonical template exists, and the current preview mixes German UI
labels with English warnings, imposes a hard-coded 10-character minimum answer length,
and fixes the preview drawer at a static width.

### Desired outcome

A canonical WAIE workshop template (Input → Assessment → Classification → Feedback) is
shipped with the product, and the editor's preview becomes a workshop-ready test/trace
experience with English UI and workflow-configurable answer constraints.

## Scope

### In scope

- Canonical WAIE free-text assessment template as the shipped workshop template.
- Preview experience restructured as a Test tab and a Trace tab.
- Test tab: question display, student answer input, run action, results display (score,
  classification, feedback).
- English UI for the participant-facing preview, with localization support.
- Answer length minimum configurable by the workflow, not fixed in the UI.
- Answer length maximum configurable by the workflow (the existing system enforces a
  maximum input constraint; it becomes workflow configuration).

### Out of scope

- Multiple additional workshop templates (the gallery is generic, see SPEC-0003).
- Full internationalization framework beyond EN/DE for participant-facing strings.

## Actors

- Participant (anonymous): runs and adapts the WAIE workflow.
- Facilitator: demonstrates the WAIE workflow during the guided part.

## User scenarios

### US-001 — Adapt one part of the workflow

As a participant,
I want a canonical assessment workflow where I can modify the rubric, feedback
strategy, or add a validation block,
so that I can perform the workshop assignment directly.

Priority: P1

Independent value: this is the workshop's core exercise.

### US-002 — Test the assessment end to end

As a participant,
I want to enter a question and student answer, run the assessment, and see score,
classification, and feedback together,
so that I can evaluate the effect of my changes.

Priority: P1

Independent value: closes the edit → test loop.

### US-003 — Configure answer constraints

As a facilitator,
I want the minimum answer length to be part of the workflow,
so that short-answer grading scenarios are not blocked by a fixed UI rule.

Priority: P2

Independent value: makes the tool usable beyond long free-text answers.

### US-004 — Cap overly long answers

As a facilitator,
I want the maximum answer length to be part of the workflow,
so that I can control input size and cost per assessment run.

Priority: P2

Independent value: preserves the existing maximum-input protection while making it
configurable per workflow instead of hard-coded.

## Functional requirements

### FR-001 — Canonical WAIE template

The system SHALL ship a canonical WAIE free-text assessment template structured as:
Input (question, student answer) → Assessment (rubric, rubric prompt, LLM, score) →
Classification → Feedback (feedback prompt, LLM, feedback output).

### FR-002 — Test tab

WHEN the user opens the preview's Test tab,
the system SHALL display the question (read-only, sourced from the workflow's question
node), a student answer input, a run action, and a results area.

### FR-003 — Question editing via inspector

WHEN the user wants to change the question,
the system SHALL provide editing through the question node in the inspector, not as a
runtime input in the Test tab.

### FR-004 — Results display

WHEN a test run completes,
the system SHALL display the resulting score, classification, and feedback in the
results area.

### FR-005 — Trace tab

WHEN the user opens the preview's Trace tab,
the system SHALL display the run trace as defined in SPEC-0006.

### FR-006 — English participant UI

The participant-facing preview interface SHALL be presented in English by default.

### FR-007 — Workflow-configurable minimum answer length

WHILE a workflow defines a minimum answer length,
the test tab SHALL enforce that value instead of any fixed UI-level minimum.

### FR-008 — No fixed answer-length policy

The preview SHALL NOT impose a fixed hard-coded minimum or maximum answer length.

### FR-008a — Workflow-configurable maximum answer length

WHILE a workflow defines a maximum answer length,
the test tab SHALL reject submissions exceeding that value with the configured limit
stated.

### FR-008b — Consistent length bounds

WHEN a workflow defines both a minimum and a maximum answer length,
the system SHALL enforce the pair consistently (minimum not greater than maximum).

### FR-009 — Workshop preflight

WHEN the workshop entry is opened,
the system SHALL perform a preflight check covering: backend connectivity, workshop
template availability, required node types registered, and provider/model health (at
least one allowed LLM model available and its provider reachable), and SHALL present
the results before the participant starts.

### FR-010 — Facilitator readiness view

WHEN the facilitator opens the workshop readiness view,
the system SHALL display the preflight check results for the workshop.

## Non-functional requirements

### NFR-001 — Localization readiness

Participant-facing preview strings SHALL be extractable for localization (at minimum EN
and DE).

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-001 — WAIE template available

Traces to: FR-001

```gherkin
Given the template gallery
When the user browses workflow templates
Then the canonical WAIE free-text assessment template is available and matches the Input → Assessment → Classification → Feedback structure
```

### AC-002 — End-to-end test run

Traces to: FR-002, FR-004

```gherkin
Given the WAIE workflow is open in the editor
When the user enters a student answer and runs the assessment
Then the results area shows a score, a classification, and feedback
```

### AC-003 — Question edited in inspector only

Traces to: FR-003

```gherkin
Given the WAIE workflow is open
When the user edits the question through the question node in the inspector
Then the Test tab displays the updated question
And the Test tab provides no question input field
```

### AC-004 — Trace tab available

Traces to: FR-005

```gherkin
Given a run has been executed
When the user opens the Trace tab
Then the run trace is displayed as defined in SPEC-0006
```

### AC-005 — English UI

Traces to: FR-006

```gherkin
Given the preview is open
When the user views the test tab
Then all participant-facing labels and messages are in English
```

### AC-006 — Configurable answer minimum

Traces to: FR-007, FR-008

```gherkin
Given a workflow whose minimum answer length is 0
When the user submits an empty answer attempt shorter than 10 characters
Then the run is permitted (no fixed 10-character block applies)
And when the workflow sets a minimum of 20 characters, a 15-character answer is rejected with the configured limit stated
```

### AC-006a — Configurable answer maximum

Traces to: FR-008a, FR-008b

```gherkin
Given a workflow whose maximum answer length is 500 characters
When the user submits a 600-character answer
Then the submission is rejected with the configured limit stated
And when no maximum is configured, no maximum-length block applies
```

### AC-007 — Preflight blocks broken workshop entry

Traces to: FR-009

```gherkin
Given no LLM model is allowed or no provider is reachable
When the participant opens the workshop entry
Then the preflight reports the failing check
And the participant is not started into a broken workshop
```

### AC-008 — Facilitator readiness view

Traces to: FR-010

```gherkin
Given a facilitator prepares the workshop
When the facilitator opens the workshop readiness view
Then all preflight checks are displayed with pass/fail state
```

## Edge cases

- Test run while another run is in flight → previous run's results are superseded
  clearly or the new run is rejected with feedback.
- WAIE template used outside a workshop → fully functional as a normal template.

## Business rules

- The WAIE template is the canonical workshop starting point; there SHALL be exactly
  one canonical WAIE template.

## Constraints

- None beyond existing template format (SPEC-0003).

## Dependencies

- SPEC-0003 (template mechanism), SPEC-0004 (workspace-owned copies), SPEC-0006
  (trace), SPEC-0014 (workshop join flow and preflight context).
- SPEC-0010 (composite provider+model reference used by the WAIE template and the
  provider/model health check).
- SPEC-0012 (allowed-models definition the preflight verifies against).

## Assumptions

- The existing TaskView result rendering (text outputs, scores, classifications) can
  be reused for the results area.
- The WAIE template references a model by provider id + model id (composite
  reference, SPEC-0010); the workshop preflight verifies that model is allowed and
  its provider reachable before participants start.

## Open questions

- None currently.

## Success criteria

- A participant can complete the assignment (modify rubric / feedback / add
  validation) and verify the effect with a test run in under 10 minutes.
- A facilitator can verify workshop readiness (backend, template, node types, model,
  provider) before the session starts.

## Change history
