# NodeGrade (automatic short answer grading tool)

## Overview

This repository provides an app for automated task evaluation. Using an intuitive node graph interface, users can create and configure tasks, which are then evaluated by a by the system. The system consults worker units if necessary. The worker units are models hosted using the openAPI standard.

This mono repository, named `NodeGrade`, is designed to encompass a server, a frontend Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed in React, and a shared library package.
Created and maintained by David Fischer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- Yarn 4 (or Corepack)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HASKI-RAK/NodeGrade.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `packages/backend` directory and add the following content:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/DATABASENAME?schema=public"
   ```
   Replace the connection string with your own database connection string.
4. Generate the Prisma client and apply the migrations:
   ```bash
   yarn setup
   ```

### Running the Project

To run the project in a development environment, use the following command in the root directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch both the server and the frontend PWA in development mode.

### Benchmarking

To run a benchmark, send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/v1/benchmark` with the following body:

```json
{
  "path": "<your_path>",
  "data": {
    "question": "What is 1+1?",
    "realAnswer": "2",
    "answer": "2"
  }
}
```

Replace `<your_path>` with the path you want to benchmark. When you launch the application as in chapter "Running the Project", you can specify the path in the URL. After you hit save, the graph for the path will be saved in the database and you can use it for benchmarking.

> Note: The graph has to have the following nodes for the benchmark to work: "Answer Input", "question", "feedback output". You can use multiple of these nodes.

## Structure

The project is structured into multiple workspaces located under `packages/*`, enabling seamless integration and development of the individual components.

### Server

The server component, implemented in TypeScript, provides the backend functionality for the application. It stores graph data based on the current path using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a database toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM). The server also provides an API for the frontend PWA to interact with the evaluated graph in the backend using websockets.

### Frontend PWA

Developed in React, the frontend PWA offers a responsive and interactive user experience. It provides a node editor for creating and configuring tasks. Users see a form for submitting their solution to the task, which is then evaluated by the server.

### Library Package

The library package includes shared resources and utilities used across the server and the frontend PWA. These include node types and websocket message types.

## Example Usage

TODO

## Docker

TODO

## Scripts

- **Development**: `yarn dev` - Runs both the server and frontend in development mode.
- **Lint**: `yarn lint` - Lints the codebase for both the server and frontend.

abstract = {NodeGrade tries to provide a suitable solution for the problem of time-intensive short answer grading. This research focuses simultaneously on performance, functionality and user experience, which is underlined by a triangulated approach. The evaluation results show comparable performance of NodeGrade on public datasets, even outperforming GPT-4 on the SemEval 2013 Task 7. Matching of NodeGrade’s output with multiple human expert raters reveals some weaknesses regarding cases at the lower and upper boundary. In terms of user experience, the interviewed and observed students recognized both positive facets, like better learning support and helpful feedback, and negative sides, including technical limitations and lack of transparency. Overall, NodeGrade promises high potential for further practical use and testing in the field of software engineering education and automatic short answer grading.},
